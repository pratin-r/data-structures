not the best solution but ive used priority queue since i was revising about it.

i) PriorityQueue is a data structure which follows binary heap but the actual implementation is done in ArrayList.

ii) Heap's main rule is that it should be 
    a) the tree should be filled from left to right.
    b) a complete binary tree (all levels are full except the last level).

iii) There are two types of binary heap which is the min-heap and max-heap. In min-heap, the root node must be lesser than the other two child node and the vice versa goes for max-heap.


class Solution {
    public int lastStoneWeight(int[] stones) {
        if (stones.length == 1) {
            return stones[0];
        }
        Queue<Integer> q = new PriorityQueue<>();
        Arrays.stream(stones).forEach(v -> q.offer(-v));
        while (q.size() > 1) {
            int a = Math.abs(q.poll()), b = Math.abs(q.poll());
            q.offer(-(a - b));
        }
        return Math.abs(q.poll());
    }
}
